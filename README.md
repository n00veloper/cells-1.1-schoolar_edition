# cells-1.1-schoolar_edition
a little simulation of cells that i made, mainly to learn a little about pygame and circles
about the game:

red cells move every tick, reducing their vitality
if 0 their die
when touching another red, they battle reducing their vitality until one of then reach 0
if touch one green they just sum both vitality and the green dies

green cells generate vitality every tick

every tick there is a 2% chance of any cell to spawn, for each cell

the code is well explained and i can awnser any question directly on github or in dev@n00veloper.com (checked weekly)
